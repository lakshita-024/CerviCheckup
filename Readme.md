## Introduction
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer. The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Central America, and South-East Asia. In contrast, it is the second most frequent cancer among women in India. It is a clinically staged disease that could be treated with early detection and intervention, reducing mortality and improving patient outcomes.I have tried to evaluate the performances of different machine-learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic regression, random forest, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), decision tree, and Adaboost for predicting cervical cancer.
